# play_process
The Play Process Tool is designed for educational and research purposes, specifically for understanding and demonstrating process injection techniques on Windows systems. The script allows injecting a DLL into a target process using different injection techniques.

Use Cases:

Educational Demonstrations: Ideal for classroom settings or training sessions where the goal is to illustrate how process injection works.
Research and Development: Useful for security researchers and developers working on defensive or offensive security tools, providing a practical way to test and analyze various injection methods.

Tabletop Exercises: Suitable for simulating real-world attack scenarios in a controlled environment to test and improve defensive measures.

Requirements

Python 3.x
psutil library (for APC injection technique)

Install required Python packages:

          pip install psutil

Compile the DLL:

Write and compile a simple DLL in C++:


              #include <windows.h>
              
              BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved) {
                  switch (ul_reason_for_call) {
                      case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
                          MessageBox(NULL, "DLL Injected!", "Success", MB_OK);
                          break;
                      case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
                      case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
                      case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
                          break;
                  }
                  return TRUE;
              }


Usage

Run the Python script:

              python play_process.py <pid> <path_to_dll> [<method>]

<pid>: Process ID of the target process.
<path_to_dll>: Path to the DLL to be injected.
[<method>]: Optional injection method (CreateRemoteThread, NtCreateThreadEx, APC). Defaults to CreateRemoteThread.

# Ethical Considerations: This tool is intended for responsible use in controlled environments. Unauthorized process injection is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission before using this tool on any system. Misuse can lead to severe legal consequences and potential harm to systems.
